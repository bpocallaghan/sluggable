# Generate slugs when saving Laravel Eloquent models

Provides a HasSlug trait that will generate a unique slug when saving your Laravel Eloquent model. 

The slugs are generated with Laravel `str_slug` method, whereby spaces are converted to '-'.

```php
$model = new EloquentModel();
$model->name = 'laravel is awesome';
$model->save();

echo $model->slug; // ouputs "laravel-is-awesome"
```

## Installation

Update your project's `composer.json` file.

```bash
composer require bpocallaghan/sluggable
```

## Usage

Your Eloquent models can use the `Bpocallaghan\Sluggable\HasSlug` trait and the `Bpocallaghan\Sluggable\SlugOptions` class.

The trait has a protected method `getSlugOptions()` that you can implement for customization. 

Here's an example:

```php
class YourEloquentModel extends Model
{
    use HasSlug;
    
    protected function getSlugOptions()
    {
        return SlugOptions::create()
            ->slugSeperator('-')
            ->generateSlugFrom('name')
            ->saveSlugTo('slug');
    }
}
```

## Config

You do not have to add the method in you model (the above will be used as default). It is only needed when you want to change the default behaviour.

By default it will generate a slug from the `name` and save to the `slug` column.

It will suffix a `-1` to make the slug unique. You can disable it by calling `makeSlugUnique(false)`.

It will use the `-` as a separator. You can change this by calling `slugSeperator('_')`.

You can use multiple fields as the source of the slug `generateSlugFrom(['firstname', 'lastname'])`.

You can also pass a `callable` function to `generateSlugFrom()`.

Have a look [here for the options](https://github.com/bpocallaghan/sluggable/blob/master/src/SlugOptions.php) and available config functions.
